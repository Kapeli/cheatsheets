            A range permits a command to be applied to a group of lines in the current buffer.
            For most commands, the default range is the current line.

            * `:21s/old/new/g` - Line 21
            * `:1s/old/new/g` - First line
            * `:$s/old/new/g` - Last line
            * `:%s/old/new/g` - All lines
            * `:.,$s/old/new/g` - Current line to end

            The arguments that you can use for the substitute commands:

            * `[c]` Confirm each substitution. Vim positions the cursor on the matching string. You can type:
              * `y`      to substitute this match
              * `n`      to skip this match
              * `<Esc>`   to skip this match
              * `a`      to substitute this and all remaining matches {not in Vi}
              * `q`      to quit substituting {not in Vi}
              * `CTRL-E`  to scroll the screen up {not in Vi}
              * `CTRL-Y`  to scroll the screen down {not in Vi}

            * `[e]` When the search pattern fails, do not issue an error message and, in particular, continue in maps as if no error occurred
            * `[g]`  Replace all occurrences in the line. Without this argument, replacement occurs only for the first occurrence in each line
            * `[i]`  Ignore case for the pattern
            * `[I]`  Don't ignore case for the pattern
            * `[p]`  Print the line containing the last substitute

            The following commands move over words or WORDS.

            A word consists of a sequence of letters, digits and underscores, or a sequence of other non-blank characters, separated with white space (spaces, tabs, &lt;EOL&gt;). This can be changed with the 'iskeyword' option.

            A WORD consists of a sequence of non-blank characters, separated with white space. An empty line is also considered to be a word and a WORD.
